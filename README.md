# Hangman Game

This is a simple console-based implementation of the Hangman game in C#. The game allows the player to guess a word by entering one letter at a time. The player has a limited number of attempts (6 lives) to guess the word correctly before losing the game.

## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a list of words stored in a text file.
- Displays underscores for unguessed letters and correctly guesses letters.
- Tracks remaining lives for incorrect guesses.
- Shows an ASCII representation of a hanging figure based on the remaining lives.
- Allows the player to replay the game.

## Prerequisites

Before running the game, ensure that you have the following:

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or any other C#-compatible IDE.
- .NET SDK version 6.0 or higher.
